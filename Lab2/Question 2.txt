1- Regression Problem
2- Target var: Car price (Price_USD)
3- what our model expected to do: Expected to predict and learn the car prices based on some information about the car itself

Problem description:

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts car prices in USD based on various inputs (features) of the vehicle. 

The dataset includes information such as the car’s brand, manufacturing year, fuel type, transmission, and other technical specifications. 

By learning the relationship between these features and the car’s price, the model can provide accurate price predictions and help analyze the factors that influence a car’s market value.
