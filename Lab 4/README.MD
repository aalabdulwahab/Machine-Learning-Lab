In this lab, we prepared the car dataset for machine learning by:

Adding and handling missing values

Detecting and treating outliers

Applying Min-Max scaling and Standardization

Performing PCA for dimensionality reduction

The results showed weak correlation between features, so PCA did not significantly reduce the data.
This lab helped practice essential data preprocessing techniques before building models.
